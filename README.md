### Owen Daigle
My name is Owen Daigle. I am currently a student in Computer Engineering at uOttawa. 

I am interested in mostly computer hardawre such as building computers, hosting servers, virtualization (really cool), rechargeable batteries, using old tech (that really should not be used anymore), and all sorts of weird stuff. 

I am always willing to learn and am open to any job offers or interviews, however know that I am in school so will only be available during my 4 month long co op opportunities. In Ottawa ON. Find more at [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/owen-daigle)
